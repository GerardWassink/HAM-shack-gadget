Building a clock / thermometer / GPS locator with fallback to NTP

Today I worked on version 0.1 of my new project. It’s in the prototype stage at this time. For this test it’s an Arduino Uno (clone by Velleman), two DS18B20 temperature sensors and two 20 x 4 displays.

This first version is for setting up the code base. The temperature sensors do work. One is the room temperature, the second one is on top of my desktop computer (that’s why it’s indicating 25.13 C at the time).

The date and time as received from the GPS satellite are shown, as are the latitude and longitude.

## Future plans

## Enclosure and keyboard

Of course in the end a nice enclosure will complete the build. I might even throw in a small 4 x 4 keyboard to enhance the operation and make it a multi functional work horse…
